# CompArch-Proj3

This repository contains the code for a group project that I worked on in my computer architecture class.

The project goal was to build a simple instruction set architecture (ISA) simulator using a language of the group's choice. My group chose scala, and I decided to also create a julia version. We worked on an example python version in class.
